  <h3>Russia</h3>
  <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRvlGDCpIJqw2BOFglcfsRjdR-7eoaLuAPqFTKxz0l9nLB21HXgxf_CezIRdnNQQV_lr5g&usqp=CAU"> 
  <p> Russia celebrates Christmas on January 7th due to the relations with the Julian Calendar that the Russian Orthodox church had been accustomed to. The Julian Calendar is 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar. 
    Much of the 20th century, while Russia was controlled by the Soviet Union, Christmas was banned as a traditional holiday as Russia was perceived as an Athiest country. With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, religious holidays like Christmas had returned to the country. 
    
    One of the Christmas customs in Russia is they will cover their floors and tables with hay to represent baby Jesus's manger. Next, a white table cloth is then laid out to symbolize the clothes Jesus was swaddled in. 
    
    The type of food that Russians eat for Christmas is called Nativity Fast; it is meatless and is made up of twelve meals to represent the twelve apostles. These foods consist of Lenten bread, Kutya, Vegetarian style borscht, or solyanka served with salads, sauerkraut, dried fruit, potatoes, and beans typically served on Christmas Eve. Following Christmas Day, the main course will consist of pork, goose, or other meat dishes. The side dishes will consist of aspic, stuffed pies, and various desserts. 
    
    The name of the Russian Santa Claus is named Ded Moroz, or Father Frost. In Russia, New Year's has more significant importance than Christmas as on New Year's Eve, Ded Moroz would place presents on the New Year tree than the Christmas Tree that we in America are accustomed to. Typically New Year's and Christmas have 2 observation dates due to the Julian calendar as stated before. 
    
    In conclusion, Russia's traditions are different compared to the U.S as we separate New Year's and Christmas as individual holidays. Meanwhile, in Russia, they have their holidays jointly tied with New Years. With how diverse the US is, every family in the US has different ways of celebrating the holiday when it comes to the Christmas meal. The most notable dish in the US is either roasted turkey or ham, comparatively that of the Nativity Fast followed by the main course that consists of meats. Lastly, with how New Year's intertwines with Christmas in Russia, we have our traditional Christmas tree in the U.S while Russia has its New Year tree to start the New Year and celebration of their 2nd observed Christmas date on January 7th. </p>

  <h4>Philippines</h4>

 <p>In the Philippines, Christmas is one of the most anticipated holidays of the year. They start celebrating the holiday in September as Christmas carols in shops start. September is the start of what Filpino refers to as "Ber" months (September, October, November, and December). Next, the formal Christmas celebrations start on 16th December when many people go to the first nine pre-dawn. In the early masses before Christmas, they're called "Simbang Gabi" in Filipino. The last mass is on Christmas day, followed by more Christmas celebrations continue to the First Sunday in January when Epiphany or the Feast of the Three Kings is celebrated. 

  The general population of Filipinos is Christians that are about 80% of people being Catholics, thus making Christmas the most important holiday in the Philippines. Christmas customs are a mixture of western and native Filipinos traditions due to Christianity becoming widely known in The Philippines in the 1500s when missionaries from countries as Portugal and Spain traveled the area and influenced the people. With that adaptation, the people in the Philippines also have Santa Claus, Christmas Trees, Christmas cards, and Christmas carols influenced from western countries. 
  
  Christmas Eve is important in the Philippines as many people stay awake all night into Christmas day. During Christmas Eve evening, Christians go to church to hear the last "simbang gabi", then followed a midnight feast, called Noche Buena. Noche Buena is an open house celebration with family, friends, and neighbors to wish everyone a Merry Christmas. Typical foods that these events contain are Lechon, ham, fruit salad, rice cakes (bibingka and puto bumbong) sweets, steamed rice, and drinks. 
  
  In conclusion, the Philippines celebrate their Christmas earlier compared to the U.S. With the majority of the population in the Philippines being Christians, Christmas is the most important holiday, while the U.S is much more diverse and cannot replicate the same traditions as the Philippines as we only celebrate Christmas on a singular day. The similarities that they share are having the same Santa Claus, Christmas carol, and Christmas cards traditions. </p>

 <p>Similar to Russia, Ethiopia and Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Chruch also celebrate Christmas on January 7th due to the Ethiopian Calendar having different months with Christmas being on the 29th of Tahsas. Ethiopian Calendar originated from the Coptic Orthodox Church (based in Egypt). 

  On Christmas day, Ethiopian Orthodox Chruch is called Ganna or Genna. Most people will go to church on Christmas day to celebrate the holiday. 
  
  Many people in Ethiopia will partake in a special Advent fast during the 43 days before Christmas. The fast starts on the 25th of November and is known as the "Fast of the Prophets". During this time frame, only one vegan meal is eaten each day. The reason why it's vegan is due to during the fast, meat, dairy, eggs, and wine cannot be eaten. 
  
  For Ganna, people will be dressed in white. They will typically wear a traditional garment called a Netela. It's a thin white cotton piece of cloth with brightly colored stripes across the ends. On Christmas Eve, people will go to a church mass called "Gahad of Christmas" at 6 PM and the service finished about 3:00 AM on Christmas Day. 
  
  On the day of the celebration for Christmas, as people enter the church they are welcomed with the choir singing from the outer circle. Everyone is given a candle, the people walk around the church three times in a solemn procession, holding the candles. Next, they go to a second circle to stand during the service. The men and boys are separated from the women and girls. The center circle is the most important and holy place in the church and is where the priest serves the Holy Communion or Mass. 
  
  Traditional Christmas foods in Ethopia include "wat" which is a thick and spicy stew that contains meat and vegetables. Wat is eaten on a plate of "injera", a flatbread. 
  
  Lastly, twelve days after Ganna, on January 19th, Ethiopians start the three-day celebration of Timkat. This celebrates the baptism of Jesus. The children walk to a church service. They wear crowns and robes of the church they belong to meanwhile adults wear the Netela. The priests wear red and white robes alongside fringed umbrellas. 
  
  In conclusion, Ethiopia is community driven that goes to the Church to celebrate Christmas. While in the U.S traditions can vary by the family and background they come from. As Christianity may have some similar traditions related to the Church, most average American families will only celebrate Christmas day, open gifts, have a big feast, and look forward to the New Year. While in Ethiopia, they will have a fast before Christmas, a service on Christmas Day, and a three-day event on January 19th for the baptism of Jesus. </p>
